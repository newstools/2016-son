It&rsquo;s happening again &ndash; that friend of yours who doesn&rsquo;t really &lsquo;get&rsquo; the internet is sharing a giant block of text about Facebook and privacy. And unless you cut and paste the WHOLE THING, Mark Zuckerberg is going to blow your account right open &ndash; and share all your dick pics with the entire world. Except he isn&rsquo;t, of course &ndash; it&rsquo;s a hoax, a well-worn one (here&rsquo;s Snopes on it), which does the rounds every so often, and which has no effect on Facebook&rsquo;s rights over your images. Rest assured, though, Facebook isn&rsquo;t about to suddenly make private posts public, or start charging, or whatever &ndash; it&rsquo;s a business, and they don&rsquo;t want to anger their consumers.Facebook said in 2012, &lsquo;There is a rumor circulating that Facebook is making a change related to ownership of users&rsquo; information or the content they post to the site. This is false.&rsquo; &lsquo;They control how that content and information is shared. That is our policy, and it always has been.&rsquo; Here&rsquo;s hoax-debunking site Snopes take on the post &ndash; which comes in several versions. They all have one thing in common &ndash; they have no effect whatsoever on Facebook&rsquo;s rights over images and other content posted to the network. As with most online services, users agree by using Facebook to abide by the terms of several documents including its privacy policy and terms and conditions. Posts you make to the network will not affect Facebook&rsquo;s rights over your images &ndash; you&rsquo;ve already signed up to a &lsquo;contract&rsquo;, in effect.-metro.co.uk
