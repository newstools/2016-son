Thanks to CBS, a network so down with today&rsquo;s cool kids that it&rsquo;s currently airing a "Millenials vs. Gen X" edition of Survivor (as well as a sitcom that has offended millenials, womp womp) you may soon be able to play Candy Crush... while binge-watching Candy Crush. Because yes, CBS executives have greenlit a new series based on the ridiculously addictive game. "We are huge fans of Candy Crush and, like so many others, we know the &lsquo;rush&rsquo; of advancing to the next level of the game," said Glenn Geller, CBS Entertainment&rsquo;s president, who has clearly never actually played Candy Crush. In case you&rsquo;ve (like Glenn) somehow avoided the game&rsquo;s lure, the aim of the original puzzle game is to match up candies in a grid according to color, earning points for every row of three or more. It&rsquo;s more fun that it sounds &mdash; roughly 18 billion rounds of the game are reportedly played each month around the world. How exactly is this going to work on TV? It&rsquo;ll be a hour-long "live-action game show, Entertainment Weekly reports, in which teams of two contestants will use their &ldquo;wits and physical agility to compete on enormous, interactive game boards featuring next generation technology.&rdquo; Producer Matt Kunitz, whose game show track record includes Wipeout for ABC and Fear Factor for NBC, promises a "larger-than-life, physical game show " that will "amp up the action and visuals in our huge Candy Crush Arena.&rdquo; And to be fair, when a producer from Wipeout and Fear Factor promises you an "ARENA," it&rsquo;s time to get excited.
