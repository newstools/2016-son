Folinic acid, a drug derived from folic acid (a synthetic form of vitamin B9), could improve autistic children's ability to communicate, according to a study published in the journal Molecular PsychiatryPrevious studies have shown that women who take folate supplements before conception and during pregnancy lower their risk of having a child with autism. Vitamin B9 (folic acid) plays an important role in the formation of red blood cells, the nervous system and the immune system, and wound healing. It is required for the production of new cells, which makes it particularly important during periods of embryonic and fetal development We know, for example, that before conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy, B9 helps to protect the child from conditions such as spina bifida, harelip, and heart problems, and it decreases the risk of miscarriage. One major folate food source is plant leaves. It is also found in brewers' yeast, green vegetables (spinach, cabbage, and salad leaves), seeds such as corn and chickpeas, liver, lentils, and seaweed. According to this latest study, folinic acid, which is a reduced form of folic acid, could improve children's ability to communicate and express themselves through language. The researchers followed 47 children, with an average age of 7, who had Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or communication difficulties, for 12 weeks. The first group took a high dose of folinic acid (2mg/kg, up to 50mg per day) and the second group were given a placebo.&nbsp; The study was able to identify specific blood markers which can predict treatment response in children with autism and verbal communication difficulties. The findings showed that the participants with folate receptor autoantibodies had a more favorable response to the folinic acid treatment. Verbal communication was much improved in the participants who took folinic acid, compared with those who were given the placebo.-sowetanlive.co.za
