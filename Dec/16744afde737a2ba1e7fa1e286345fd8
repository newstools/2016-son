Sy het moeg geword van modellering agentskappe wat die heeltyd s&ecirc;, &lsquo;Nee dankie, ons het alreeds swart modelle&rsquo;. Toe besluit Deddeh Howard om hulle op &lsquo;n briljante manier te wys dat sy ook &lsquo;n kans verdien.Die Liberiese model het besluit om terug te kap, deur met fotograaf Raffael Dickreuter te werk om veldtogte deur top ontwerpers soos Gucci, Victoria&rsquo;s Secret en Dolce and Gabana te herskep. In die foto reeks genaamd &lsquo;Black Mirror&rsquo;, s&ecirc; Deddeh wou sy aandag bring op die nood vir rasse-diversiteit in die mode en modellering bedryf. - you.co.za&nbsp;So proud of you @secretofdd what u did is amazing work.You are inspiring so many young black girls like me to stand up for ourselves.

Liberian/American Model Deddeh Howard struggled to break into the Los Angeles modelling industry as agencies would tell her they had enough black models. To build the understanding of the need for more diversity in this industry, and the media in general, Howard started the #blackmirror, campaign recreating some adverts by todays biggest models such as Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid. Lets support her this #workingwomenwednesday and get the #blackmirrorchallenge trending, show us some of your best pics mirroring non-black models.

Did you say the same thing to the 50-100 white models you already have? If @kendalljenner can do it, so can me or any other race!! Here is my prof, so open your eyes and see that Fashion is not black or white! Life is not black or white. I'm just like her. #blackmirror #blackmodelsmatter Right guys?

At least that's what my parents thought me and that's what I believe in. I believe we can be whoever we want to be, so don't let anyone tell you're not what you want to be. If they can do it! So can you. It's about time we stand up together..Dream and Believe. I'm personally fighting for more diversity especially more black models to be seen on bill boards, movies, TV commercials, advertisements etc for us all. #blackmirrow.
