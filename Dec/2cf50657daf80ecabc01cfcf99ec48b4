My girlfriend of over 2 years (yes you may think it&rsquo;s a short period) has decided we aren&rsquo;t good for each other anymore &ndash; 2 years is a long time to bond, to be happy with. Now we are separating I don&rsquo;t feel like I can cope without her full love any longer. She was and still is my everything. I don&rsquo;t think I will be able to get over this. I don&rsquo;t want to wait till I get over the situation because she&rsquo;s the only one that&rsquo;s ever made me truly happy.This isn&rsquo;t (girlfriend&rsquo;s name) fault at all, we both just weren&rsquo;t right for each other in the end. I did a lot of bad in the relationship that may of led up to this. From day one to the end, I should of cared the same as I did during happy times.I guess people slowly move apart from each other and I would do anything to stop this but it&rsquo;s something that I have no control over.I know I&rsquo;m being selfish considering I have my two families, my dog snoop, my reptiles &amp; my princess (girlfriend&rsquo;s name).&lsquo;I&rsquo;d like to wish upon everyone to listen to these last wishes.&lsquo;To remember the good times I shared with people I&rsquo;d like my favourite song to be played for me &ndash; Lion King circle of life. I would like someone to look after snoop for me until he joins me. He&rsquo;s looked after me through hard/good times and I&rsquo;m sure he will look after whomever chooses to take it upon them.&lsquo;The flat and car I own, is now (girlfriend&rsquo;s name). Use my bank account to pay for it &amp; the clothes I have that are worth money, eBay them to get more for it (don&rsquo;t throw them it&rsquo;s pointless). Once you have enough money to get a place better, make sure you are moving out with someone that cares. That won&rsquo;t just be there for the meantime, then move out but please take the photo on the wall with you. Please sell all my belongs, like consoles and everything that&rsquo;s worth something, the furniture, once you are done with, give to someone else that&rsquo;s in need and looking for somewhere to live. I wish everyone to look after each other, stop falling out and remember how precious life is. The presents I have bought (girlfriend&rsquo;s name) they&rsquo;re in loft), take them and have a good Christmas, a happy one. It&rsquo;s what I want &amp; a lot of thought went into them.As I&rsquo;m writing this upset and I can see snoop feeling the pain I&rsquo;m feeling while whining (either that or he&rsquo;s hungry lol)&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to all the people I have hurt, let down and just generally upset. If I could I&rsquo;d make everyone forgive me but I&rsquo;m not god. Yet. I am not a believer of god, I&rsquo;m just imagining someone powerful, who&rsquo;s indestructible. I wish I was.&lsquo;Please Facebook, don&rsquo;t take my post down. The reason I&rsquo;m writing this for Facebook is because maybe this note will leave an eye opener to the people that are looking for happiness, something I&rsquo;ve looked for my whole life. I want my family and friends to read this and to know, I care. I love everyone so dearly. I&rsquo;m out. Don&rsquo;t try save me it&rsquo;s what I want.&rdquo;let&rsquo;s play hide and seek but never stop looking for true happiness.&rdquo;
