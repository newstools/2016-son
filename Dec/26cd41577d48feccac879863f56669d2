Toe die 32-jarige Dan Clay sy Instagram-profiel van &ldquo;privaat&rdquo; na &ldquo;public&rdquo; verander het, het hy nie besef dat sy post, oor hom wat soos Carrie Bradshaw aangetrek is, soveel traksie gaan kry nie. Binne &rsquo;n paar uur is sy post deur die groot Sex And The City fan-blad ge-repost. Dit het veroorsaak dat hy liefdevolle kommentaar kry inslutiend die van Sarah Jessica Parker self. Clay, wat &rsquo;n &ldquo;Miranda-agtige werk&rdquo; het as &rsquo;n strategiese en innovasie konsultant in New York, is sedert sy varsity-dae &rsquo;n groot fan van Sex and the City. Hy het soms &ldquo;voorgegee&rdquo; dat hy die show haat, veral wanneer meisies na sy kamer gekom eht om dit te kom kyk."Maybe some women aren't meant to be tamed. Maybe they just need to run free until they find someone just as wild to run with them." I have wanted to be Carrie Bradshaw for Halloween ever since college, when I had HBO in my frat room and girls would come over and watch Sex and the City on Sundays and I would pretend that I hated it because I didn't want to give myself away. Well, the secret's out, and this is the happiest day of my life. @sarahjessicaparker sending you more love than you could even imagine ?? #carriedragshawA photo posted by Dan Clay (@dan_clay) on Oct 29, 2016 at 1:36pm PDTNoudat Clay uit die kas geklim het as &rsquo;n gay man en &rsquo;n Sex and the City-fan, wou hy baie graag as Carrie aangetrek het. Clay bly net &rsquo;n paar blokke van Bradshaw se beroemde West Village huis. Hy het met behulp van die omgewing probeer om die ikoniese tonele uit die fliek te herskep. Hoe meer sy Insta-fame groei, hoe meer ontleed hy die episodes.It can be hard out there for a single girl, but there are a few words that provide instant comfort: &ldquo;Vogue September Issue,&rdquo; &ldquo;2-for-1 Cosmopolitans,&rdquo; &ldquo;Manolo Blahnik Sample Sale,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Perfect First Date Follow-Up.&rdquo; PFDFU. It's flirty and funny. Easy, breezy, and cool. He's clearly into it and you're like a pair of purple control top pantyhose: fun and holding it all together. It takes you right back to that perfect first date, when the conversation flowed effortlessly, the spark lit instantly, and the first kiss felt like fate. As you flirt on the phone, you float on a cloud that seems to sparkle from the inside, and for a moment you forget your baggage, you forget your past, you forget how many times you&rsquo;ve felt this feeling before but it failed to last...and you smile. I couldn't help but wonder: Maybe love is like a mobile phone. When you have a good connection, you&rsquo;ve just got to keep talking and hope for the best. #CarrieDragshawA photo posted by Dan Clay (@dan_clay) on Dec 19, 2016 at 4:59am PST&ldquo;Ek kyk Sex and the City op die manier waarop mense James Joyce less,&rdquo; het hy aan Cosmoplitan.com vertel.In old westerns, the cowboy always saves the damsel in distress. But what if the cowboy is the reason she&rsquo;s distressed in the first place? Who will save the damsel when her hero is her downfall? As I was face-to-face with yet another failure on the wild frontier of love, I couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder: Maybe this was the story of the damsel who learned to save herself. After all, this is not the Old West&mdash;this is New York. And there&rsquo;s plenty of giddy up left in my honky tonk. Maybe some girls aren&rsquo;t meant to ride into the sunset. Maybe they're meant to grab their other damsels and dance under the moonlight. #CarrieDragshawA photo posted by Dan Clay (@dan_clay) on Nov 21, 2016 at 5:01am PSTTen tyde van sy post het Clay meer as 13&nbsp;000 followers (SJP ingesluit) gekry.
