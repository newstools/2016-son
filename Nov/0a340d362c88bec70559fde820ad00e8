Kansas State University student Hunter Jobbins had his car broken into over the weekend, and as crappy as that sounds, the reason why is actually pretty hilarious. Apparently the burglar saw a Kit Kat bar in the cup holder, found the car unlocked, and went in for the candy. He didn&rsquo;t take anything else, though, or vandalize the car or anything cray &mdash; he just needed his chocolate wafer fix. And had the balls to admit it. Guess there&rsquo;s no such thing as going too far when candy is involved.Jobbins tweeted out a photo of the note that the Kit Kat thief left, and naturally, it&rsquo;s getting shared like crazy.&nbsp;Left my car for maybe 15 minutes in front of the dorms and I come back to this.

If you leave a kitkat exposed, u have to assume all risk.
